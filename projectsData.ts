      "The book was designed around the development of the Hebrew script, exploring its evolution over time and across different regions. I researched various writing styles and the influences behind them, focusing on their visual and cultural differences. The process was research-driven, guided by texts from Dr. Moshe Spitzer and Dr. Ada Yardeni. Visuals were sourced from the Israel National Library’s “Ktiv” project, aiming to present the beauty and uniqueness of handwritten Hebrew scripts through an archival design approach.",

      "I created a complex, large-format broadsheet centered on selected excerpts from The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Each section highlights a key statement from the text, framed as a bold visual proclamation. To deepen the conceptual layers, I incorporated imagery drawn from George Orwell’s Animal Farm- a satirical narrative that critiques the very ideals the manifesto promotes. The interplay between revolutionary vision and dystopian reality invites reflection on the gap between theory and practice.",

The project explores the Hebrew script, scriptural traditions, and textual memory, offering a rich foundation for visual interpretation. It brings together manuscripts from diverse geographic regions and cultural backgrounds, reflecting the wide dispersion of Jewish life. The design creates a connection between the ancient and the contemporary: the manuscripts are presented in their original historical appearance, with the Hebrew letter as a central focus. Contemporary design elements—modern typography, bold color palettes, and free compositions—introduce a fresh interpretation of the archival material and open a rich visual space between past and present.",
